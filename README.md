# dsti_advent_of_code
Repository for people participating in Advent of Code 2024 to share their solutions

# Instructions
- In the folder for the year in which you are completing puzzles, create a directory with your name
- Each day should also have its own subfolder (e.g, /root/2024/"Eddie Jenkins"/"Day 1" is where files for day 1 would be stored)
- Have fun and good luck!
